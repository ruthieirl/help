**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, Sahat Yalkabov recommends to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ruthieirl/help.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```

**Note:** Sahat Yalkabov highly recommends installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

# Install
- First initialize your package.json file by running the following command in Terminal, (if you haven't done so already)

```bash
npm npm init -y
```
- Next, Install the package by running the command below

```bash
npm install --save shitsandgrins
```
